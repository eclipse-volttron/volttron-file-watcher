# volttron-file-watcher

The File Watch Publisher agent watches files listed in its configuration for changes.  The agent will detect changes to
those files and publish those changes line-by-line on the topic the user has associated with the file in the 
configuration.

The user should be careful about what files are being watched, and which historians are being used with the
File Watch Publisher.  Very long lines being output in individual messages on the message bus can result in some 
performance degradation.  Some configurations of the File Watch Publisher can affect the system (such as using I/O 
resources when a fast-moving log is being captured in a SQLite Historian), so the user should be intentional about which
files the agent is configured to watch and the topics used for publishes.

# Prerequisites

* Python 3.8

## Python

<details>
<summary>To install Python 3.8, we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a>.</summary>

```bash
# install pyenv
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv

# setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar)
export PATH="${HOME}/.pyenv/bin:${PATH}"
export PYENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# install Python 3.8
pyenv install 3.8.10

# make it available globally
pyenv global system 3.8.10
```
</details>

# Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

```shell
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

2. Install volttron and start the platform.

```shell
pip install volttron

# Start platform with output going to volttron.log
volttron -vv -l volttron.log &
```

3. Create configuration.


Create a config directory and navigate to it:

```shell
mkdir config
cd config
```

Navigate to the config directory and create a file called `filewatcher.config` then use the below example to populate this file with the correct JSON.
### Example Usage

The user wants to record logging information from the "myservice" service into a historian agent.

The user can configure the File Watch Publisher to point at the "myservice.log" file with a corresponding "record" 
topic -  for example "record/myservice/logs".  As "myservice" adds logging entries to its log file, the File Watch 
Publisher will capture each new log message and publish it to the "record/myservice/logs" topics on the message bus. 

Below is a File Watch Publisher example configuration to match the above scenario. 


#### Configuration

```json
{
    "files": [
        {
            "file": "/opt/myservice/logs/myservice.log",
            "topic": "record/myservice/logs"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Install the file watcher agent

```
vctl install volttron-file-watcher --agent-config filewatcher.config --vip-identity platform.file_watcher --start --force
```

5. Observe Data

Once installed, you should see the data being published by viewing the Volttron logs file that was created in step 2.
To watch the logs, open a separate terminal and run the following command:

```
tail -f <path to folder containing volttron.log>/volttron.log
```
### Example Publish

The following is an example publish by the File Watch Publisher installed with the above configuration.

```
Topic: record/myservice/logs
Headers: {'min_compatible_version': '3.0', 'max_compatible_version': ''}
Message: {'timestamp': '2024-01-06T00:07:09.370074Z', 'line': '2024-01-05 16:07:09,358 (volttron-file-watcher-0.1.0 63487) volttron.client.vip.agent.core(527) DEBUG: address: ipc://@/home/riley/volttron-file-watcher/volttron_home/run/vip.socket'}
